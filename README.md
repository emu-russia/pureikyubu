# Nintendo GameCube Emulator

![PNG](https://github.com/ogamespec/dolwin-docs/blob/master/ScreenShots/Ikaruga_0130.png)

Dolwin is work-in-progress emulator of Nintendo GameCube console.

The goal of the emulator is to research the hardware features of GameCube and reverse engineer technologies used to develop games for this platform.
GameCube is the hardware masterpiece of Nintendo engineers and it's a pleasure to explore this device and discover something new for yourself.

This project is revived from 2004 in 2020.

## Building Windows version

Build using Visual Studio 2019. To build, open Dolwin_VS2019.sln and click Build.

## Third-party code

Try not to use third-party libraries without special need.

(This does not apply to UI and backends.)

## Why "Dolwin"?

Dolwin was originally stands for "Nintendo *Dol*phin Emulator for *Win*dows" (Dolphin is GameCube codename).
Later `Dolphin` was changed to `GameCube`, so that there is no confusion with another emulator - Dolphin-emu.

Later public is interested in the possibility of launching and porting Dolwin in other OSes.

Therefore, a small rebranding was made, now Dolwin stands for "Nintendo GameCube Emulator not only for Windows". Lol.

Now it's easier to count Dolwin as a common noun that doesn't mean anything.
