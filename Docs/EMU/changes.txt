    Dolwin CHANGE Log.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    [27 Dec 2004 org]

    Fixed bug in EXI interrupt update. Memcards are working in Busta!!
    (You need __CARDUnlock and __CARDMountCallback presense in MAP).

    Implemented 'path' configuration dialog (to add/delete selector paths).

    More STD math : sin, cos, modf, frexp, ldexp, floor, ceil. Untested!

    File loading is a bit more informative in debugger.

    THP Hack removed completely.

    Linux bugs :
        Bug in SRAM read. EXI_CR_TLEN(exi.regs[0].cr) was EXI_CR_TLEN(exi.regs[0].len)
        SRAM reads need to be swapped. In function : "gcn_time_init".
        To boot kernel (start_kernel -> time_init) RTC should be enabled.
    Thanks to Masken for working Linux binary with MAP!

    Statusbar fixed. Now its updated every second, instead every VIINT.

    "press" command removed, since its reported as not workable.

    Beta team reported that THP hack does nothing. Removed from settings, but
    can be changed by regedit.

    Highlevel PAD driver (PADRead call). Not perfect.

    SaveMAP finished. I changed some Symbols.cpp API to support multiple sets
    of symbols. This allow me to load MAP as new set of symbols and compare it
    with current set, to check for new symbols. New "savemap" command.

    HLE hit rate APIs, to watch for most recently called HLE routines.
    New "top10" debug command :)

    Vector/matrix library workaround (not finished). Current performance increase
    ~0.3 MIPS.

    Stdc.cpp added, including memcpy/memset ATM. memcpy optionally powered by MMX.

    OS Context API finished. Tested on osdemos, BAM and Luigi. Working well.
    Performance increase ~0.1 MIPS. Note! FP Unavail. exception is unhandled in
    HLE OSContext driver! (All FPU state is saved all the time).

    OSLoadContext return is patched as RFI (not usual BLR). See Symbols.cpp,
    SYMSetHighlevel, line 97.

    Added predefined HLE calls : HLE_IGNORE, HLE_RETURN0, HLE_RETURN1, HLE_TRAP.
    HLE_IGNORE  - return immediately from call
    HLE_RETURN0 - return 0 (NULL)
    HLE_RETURN1 - return 1
    HLE_TRAP    - trap call (break execution)

    CPU timing settings now can be modified during run-time. Reacting of game
    on such "operation" is unknown (not tested).

    Games.ini API modified to support game-specific settings. CPU timing can
    be specified by unique value for every game.

    Added some patch commands, and Patch menu controls are finished.

    Added support for debugger scripts (new "script" command). Scripts are
    working like patch files (executed after every game frame).

    debugger's BLR command improved (now you can type BLR with value, to
    simulate "return VALUE;". single BLR was reacted like usual "return" in C).

    NOP command improved. Now if you mistyped NOP somewhere, you can De-NOP it,
    by "denop" command.

    Fixed debug console "fullscreen" mode ("full" command). Garbage removed.

    "press" command added to simulate controller's button pressing. Not sure,
    but this may can help to restore "lost input" :/

    Few changes and additions to MAP system, by request from beta-testers :)
    New "name"-command. Added "emu" flag to recognize emulator symbols, which
    are used in compiler dumps (like reg names). Such symbols are invisible for
    "syms"-command output and map saves.

    Some hacks on real-time clock (RTC). TBR->Realtime convertion still sux.

    Quick locked cache implementation. Star Soldier work. OS lockedcache demos
    doesnt.

    MSR_FP was 0x4000, should be 0x2000. Dolphin OS 'FP Unavailable' handler
    now implemented (FP regs are saved after thread switch). Dont see any 
    compatibility issues :(

    Known bugs : input lost when using RTC emulation :( Game's GX is continue
    to draw, but PAD became unaccessible. Reason unknown (probably wrong OSTime
    is checked somewhere).

    Summary: Massive debug improvements. Total performance increase ~0.5 MIPS.
    Real Gekko performance is about 1000 MIPS :) Current is 5-6 MIPS in emu :)

    Linux hung on start_kernel -> calibrate_delay.

    Memory cards are working. Great christmas gift!

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    [21 Nov 2004 org]

    Memcards from last 0.09 update. Not tested.

    Paired-single scaled load/store are implemented. Not tested yet.

    Found bug in decrementer assertion (example code) :
        lwz     r0, 12 (sp)
        addi    sp, sp, 8       <- when DECREMENTER_EXCEPTION is here,
        mtlr    r0              <- r0 fucked
        blr
    Decrementer exception check now only after branch instructions.

    Dolphin Video plugin is ported as Dolwin GX plugin. Zelda intro running..
    And I havent did anything else, just ported plugin o_O

    CPU Compare implemented. This allowing to compare CPU registers on two
    running emulator instancies. From source code :
        // Processing :
        //      Step 1: Run 1st Dolwin.
        //      Step 2: Load file in debugger, and start compare as server
        //      Step 3: Run 2nd Dolwin.
        //      Step 4: Switch core to recompiler, close debugger,
        //              and boot same file as 1st. Start compare as client.
        //      Step 5: After 2nd file boot, CPU compare will start to sync both Dolwins
        //      Step 6: Press F11 in 1st Dolwin debugger to execute opcode
        //      Step 7: 2nd Dolwin will execute too
        //      Step 8: Goto step 6.
    (Run Once must be enabled, to allow multiple Dolwin instancies).

    Fixed bug in DOL loader. BSS shouldnt be cleared !

    Fixed bug in AI registers, when writing something, like 0xFFFF80nn in 
    16-bit register. Sometimes I think Costis is specially doing such bugs,
    to crash Dolwin >:[ Also cubedemo is crashing after first run, because of
    small TBR value and unexpected VI interrupt. You need to wait RSOD and
    reset emulator again.

    HW update is disabled, when apploader is booting.

    'HLE Only' mode is added. This will be used, when we'll make *full* HLE
    of Dolphin OS library calls. HWUpdate is always disabled, when HLE only.

    Your MAP Maker added again. Works great.

    OSTimeFormat() fixed. Now I let Win32 work for me :) I made GC Time
    conversion as : GC Time -> FILETIME -> Real time. Not work with Dolphin
    Video :(

    WIP on profiler.

    Null AX Plugin. Simple DirectSound AX Plugin. I dont like my sound.

    Fixed bug in GCMCMPR tool for long file names with spaces (quotes).

    VI frame buffer update is disabled with first GX access.

    Small fix for GAMES.ini. comments was ended by '\n' (Unix style), and now
    it is ended by '\0xd\n' (DOS).

    Tested DVDOpenFile(). I found small bug: root was not identified, when
    root dir is "\". Added debugger's 'dvdopen' command, to quickly get
    DVD file position.

    Hardware Bailout default value ("CPU_TIME" uvar) was changed from 1000,
    to 0 (check hardware after every instruction). Too big value is crashing
    emulation. TODO : Find optimal value! Dolphin guys are using 30, btw.
    
    Here I write all timing-related variables :
         CPU Delay. How often TBR and DEC are updated. Number of opcodes.
         Hardware Update Bailout. Hardware is updated, when this counter
          become zero (HWUpdate will be called). Then set counter to initial
          value.
         Counter Factor. The value to change TBR and DEC: TBR += CF, DEC -= CF.
         Read-Clear Interrupts. Clear INTSR register, after reading. (Obsolete?)
         Real-Time Clock. DEC and TBR are updated by real-life time counter.
          Note, that all hardware update will be real-time also.
         Branch Checking Only. DEC/TBR and Hardware Bailout are updated only
          after branch instructions (or at the beginning of the group in 
          recompiler).
    This will be implemented as user-accessible vars. After all, Dolwin can
    work in three modes : Low-Level Precede, Low-Level Real-Time and High-Level.
    Whole hardware stuff will be obsolete in High-Level mode.

    BUST-A-MOVE is running slow and badly. Many GX applications are crashing on
    strange Fifo errors :(

    Dolphin Video plugin allowing to boot many games. See beta-testers reports.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    [28 Oct 2004 org]

    Final plugins specifications 1.0, for GX, AX, PAD and DVD. BBA plugin is 
    removed, NET wanted :)

    Changes on font system :
         fonts are repositioned to Data directory
         they have .SZP extension (as Nintendo)
         ANSI font can be detected by file size (its ANSI if <= than 0x3000)
         no custom Dolwin font format. both ANSI and SJIS fonts are present
          together in any console (no matter PAL or NTSC).
         SZP (formerly Yay0) encoder/decoder removed.
         UserFonts module is used only to set paths for ANSI and SJIS fonts.
         fonts are loading during EIOpen() into exi.ansiFont and exi.sjisFont.
         Japan translation table for selector is placed into UserSelector.

    ZLIB is distributed with Dolwin source code. Now GCMCMPR and DVD can be
    compiled even with missing library paths. If you want to use other ZLIB
    directory, change :
        #include "../zlib/zlib.h"
        #pragma comment(lib, "../zlib/zlibstat.lib")
    to :
        #include <zlib.h>
    (and add new "Include" and "Library" paths in VisualC options).

    Typo in VI : VI_INT_ENB (VI interrupt enable) mask was 0x20000000, must be
    0x10000000.

    Another bug in VI : "The interrupt is cleared by writing a *zero* to the
    status flag". (typically HW is writing "1" to clear interrupt, so I missed
    that VI specific).

    Ultimate PI (processor interface) API :
        PICheckInterrupts();
        PIAssertInt(u32 mask);
        PIClearInt(u32 mask);
    INTSR &= ~mask, on write.
    F|RES: i think the hw devices reset the interrupt in the PI to 0 
    if the interrupt cause is eliminated. that isnt done by software (afaik)

    AIS and AID are integrated in AI.cpp. DSP is moved to HighLevel section.

    Fixed bug on DVD stop motor command. I forgot to clear TSTART bit and
    assert DIINT. 16-bit regs added. Streaming commands are added. DVD is
    fully implemented (no visible bugs).

    DVD is using instant reads now. I have doubts about read delay.. We'll see.

    Interrupts are fixed (MSR_EE clear was before CPUException call).

    SI register unions removed. Bad idea.

    Apploader simulation implemented (tested in Zelda and AC). ReadFST is fixed.
    Zelda boot time is changed from 0.65 to 0.45 seconds, 30% faster, huhu :)

    RAM allocation through VirtualAlloc is changed to usual malloc. VirtualAlloc
    is buggy ! Dont know why, but it is, after many emu resets :(

    In some OS demos, I found better way to show "branch history" aka "callstack".
    This method is called "LR Back Chain". Compilator is using some space in
    stack, to save caller LR value, which we can obtain and get caller branch.
    See debugger's "lr" command.

    More icons added to user.

    Running back again (and new) : FreeLoader, ActionReplay, Balls (now3d), CZN,
    browseDVD (Sappharad), Galaxy Assaliant, my GameBoy emu, GChip8, maze (dovoto),
    PAD test (DesktopMan), Particles (DesktopMan), PONG :), ShipWithFont, 
    Snowlords, Terra, xRick, Yeti.

    Not well : ctr-snd (no sound), demoone / fontdemo (flickering), FreeBird
    (tearing, look at wings), Sprite by DesktopMan ("sprite" not visible),
    Tetris (no sound). Flickering mostly caused by wrong CPU timer, when 
    TBR is increased without some delay (I use 12). With "exact" CPU timers,
    all flickering is gone.

    Fireee and Pong! are not working, because they are badly compiled.

    Newest homedev: Dotrikun, CUBEDOOM and GC-Linux are still not working nice.
    Costis cubedemo is working, but crashes are often.

    This update is not 100% rewritten. But anyway, you probably need it, to
    see how work is going on.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    [16 Oct 2004 org]

    After some doubts, I made decision to change GCMCMPR compression method
    from Huffman+RLE to ZLIB. And now compression ratio is even better =)
    GCMCMPR and DVD Plugin are revised. Universe mind (god) bless ZLIB ! 

    Free Loader / Action Replay are working again (although emulation is hacky
    - mean no SYSCALL and BLR patch on __OSInitAudioSystem function).

    Improved Debugger. Added issues :
         possiblity to run in fast mode (with recompiler)
         show compiled X86 code (F3->Ctrl+Enter)
         support memory symbolic information (also see *-command)
         more commands
         memory breakpoints
         fixed Win98 console input lag (problem was in UpdateMainWindow)
         can be opened/closed any time (see below about DOLDEBUG)

    New patch files format (already tested). Can be used to skip HW read/writes
    or to NOP infinite loop branch opcodes. Cheat application is possible, but
    not allowed >:)

    MAP loader. Supported MAP formats : RAW, GCC, CodeWarrior.

    "DOLDEBUG" now controlled from GUI. It is replaced by "emu.doldebug"
    variable. This allow to open/close debugger any time.

    New "Debug" sub-menu.

    Fixed bug in VI registers (unswapped data, damn Intel with their little-
    endian format).

    File entry number (#) is shown, when user selecting it. Can be used as
    parameter for debugger's 'boot {#}' command.

    Wrote some documents, regarding emulator. Made some .bat files for project.
    Dolwin.dsm removed from project (who need build number?).

    Good old PAD plugin integrated with Dolwin project. Plugin dialogs are
    moved from 0.09 with few changes.

    PAD Plugin : F1-F24 keys are invalid (cannot be used, reserved by GUI).
    Same as CTRL, ALT and SHIFT keys.

    New symbolic information module (infinite number of symbols, fast searching).

    mojo added.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    [30 Sep 2004 org]

    Completely restructured Debugger, Memory, Interpreter and Recompiler! 
    All changes are nicely transparent from User/Hardware side :)

    I removed branch callbacks and R_IC (instruction counter). Now CPU is
    checking execptions/interrupts after every opcode. And hardware is using
    TBU/TBL registers, instead of R_IC, for timer checking. I added nice "union"
    for TBU and TBL, now compiler may use x86 flags when increasing TBL :)

    Hardware update is placed in Hardware.cpp - HWUpdate(), since BCBs
    are gone. Its called after every opcode, but theoretically can be called 
    in branch opcodes (to save some time on timers checking). HWUpdate is in
    charge of hardware mutual tasks (transfers, counters, streaming etc etc).

    I removed your toolbar and EMUBreak/EMUContinue. Its lame stuff :)
    User can pause game, by hitting "START" button, and Play/Pause/Stop
    controls are stupid. Looks like we also forgot to add "Volume" track :)

    Hardware register mappings are changed from 0xCCnnnnnn to 0x0Cnnnnnn,
    as in real (physical addressing).

    DOLWIN_VER extended to APPNAME, APPDESC, APPVER and APPBUILD. Last one
    is under control of build macro (see Dolwin.dsm).

    Disk swap-wizard simplified to DVD->Open/Close Cover & Insert Disk menus.

    Fail-safe emu output stuff (DolwinReport, DolwinError, DolwinQuestion and
    ASSERT macro) are moved from UserWindow to UserMain.

    Current working directory is restored every time, after file closed.

    Fixed minor bugs in selector (transparency bug, wrong menu controls).

    Loader cleaned-up. *.bin files now can be loaded from File->Open menu. 
    Loading offset is getting from BINORG user variable. New patch file format.

    X86 disassembler added (without MMX/SSE*/3DNow! extensions).

    Fixed major bug in branches : PC is saved in LR, even if (ctr_ok & cond_ok)
    condition was false!

    VI rewritten. Now it has precede frame timing, and homedev demos will not
    flicker, or hung in "wait retrace" anymore.

    Only PONG is running well in this update :) But without joypads though :)

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    [24 Sep 2004 org]

    ATTENTION : This is *NOT* 0.09 update! Its already 0.10.

    Whole Emulator, Hardware and HighLevel is removed temporary (There are
    still few code there, but dont look at it, it is not important, and 
    used just to support user stuff).

    Finally, all user variables are placed in list. See UserConfig.h

    New UserWindow. Now all important main window handlers are shared in "wnd".

    New user selector : I rewrote whole UserSelector code, fixed some old bugs,
    completed "Sort By" feature, added file filter dialog and item popup menu.
    GCM compression feature is integrated with emulator (by DolwinExecute()),
    and selector is able to add GMP files into list. Also I _removed_ whole 
    "Browser" code. Please, dont kick me for that, sorry but I never like it :)
    Now selector is almost looking good.

    New file utilities module : UserFile (handy).

    UserDatabase has gone. Now we have nice looking code, which is using
    GAMES.ini information, for known games/execs. See UserConfig for details.
    (Emu is still able to use "Defaults" from DVD banner).

    This is just point update, to keep source alive (I'm still having some
    problems with PC and HDDs). So in general, you may just peek in it, and
    look how is work going on :)

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    [19 Aug 2004 org]

    Savestates are temporary disabled (they are dummy), since Im planning to
    rewrite some hardware, it will be too compilicated to rewrite savestates
    also in future - I'll better redo them completely.

    PI intsr bug is fixed. I modified all hardware modules, and removed your
    hack on EXI.

    Internal plugins are removed (it wasnt good idea).

    DVD data reading now is not instantly. I added hardware delay, when reading
    more than 100 kb (will be optionally), since real DVD speed is 2-3 MB/sec.

    New plugin specifications, including DVD.

    DVD plugin with compression support added. Also I wrote GCMCMPR tool, and
    now its a part of Dolwin source code. Thus I finally cleaned or GCM 
    handling code (no more GCM.cpp, GCMFileSystem.cpp - all is gone and fit 
    nicely in DVD plugin). See details of plugin in plugspecs (PlugSpec.h)
    * untested * (tested only on BAM).

    EMUBreak and EMUContinue added, for toolbar pause control. "running" is
    changed to "emu_running" and "emu_paused" added.

    I changed some files, to add GMP support (UserLoader and UserSelector).
    See UserSelector's FillGCMInfo().

    Some changes in high-level section (Bootrom.cpp and Banner.cpp).

    Ok, so what I havent included from your last update :

        - I dont touched MC and EXI, since you probably can now use it without 
          hacks, after fixing PI bug. If not, tell me - I'll include it.
        - Thread priority controls are dummy. Please, dont use Windows GUI
          code in Emulator section, in future. Try to find better way.
        - User mapper code (and GCC MAP loader). Sure it will be integrated 
          later with new HLE core (note : Apploader is not good place to call 
          map-maker. Better initiate it in UserLoader/AutoloadMap).

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    [5 Jul 2004 org]

    Window now has sizing border. OGL resizing is not implemented yet.

    Status bar now showing "OS time", instead CLK (instruction) counter.
    OS time is just formatted TBU/TBL date and time string. This thing
    can be used to detect timing bugs.

    Added some MMU working code in memory engine. Now only BAT logic is 
    supported. MMU can be enabled/disabled by "MMU" user variable (it is
    enabled by default!). GC-Linux is still not working :(

    Internal GX is slighty improved (its grown up). Still not useful for
    gfx output.

    Added support for PAD RDST interrupt, by request from beta-testing team
    (some games are using it). SI hardware seems to be fully completed now,
    but Im not sure about PAD poll timing..

    Dolwin now can load files from command line - you may associate it with
    DOL, ELF and GCMs. This was added by request from author of EmuLoader :)

    Added small fix for userselector. See ResizeFileBrowserControl().

    Some small additions related to MMU and resizing feature.

    Fixed bug in Zelda MAP loading. It was stupid string overflow in
    HLERegisterProc(). Now its okay (MAP must be fixed though. I used
    GZLE.\maps\framework.map. I removed all stuff below ".data" and added
    "Link map of Zelda" string at the beginning of the file. Then rename it 
    to GZLEC8.map and place in $Dolwin$\Data dir). After I skipped 
    "DsetupTable__FUlUlUlUlUl" and "DsetDolbyDelay__FUlUs" in debugger, 
    I got Nintendo logo :)

    Fixed naming of R2 and R13 registers. They was SDA1 and SDA2 respectively,
    but must be vise versa. Take care about your previous reversing listings!

    Fucking buggy callstack was removed.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
