    Bits  Mnemonic        Type  Reset Description

    5     SCRESET         RW    0 .times. 0 Sample Counter Reset: When a `1` is
     written to this
                                      bit the AISLRCNT register is rest to 0
     .times. 0O.

                                      0 = No effect
                                      1 = Reset AISLRCNT register
    4     AIINTVLD        RW    0 .times. 0 Audio Interface Interrupt Valid.
     This bit controls
                                      whether AIINT is affected by the AIIT
     register
                                      matching AISLRCNT. Once set, AIINT will
     hold its
                                      last value.
                                      0 = March affects AIINT.
                                      1 = AIINT hold last value.
    3     AIINT           RW    0 .times. 0 Audio Interface Interrupt Status
     and clear. On read
                                      this bit indicates the current status of
     the audio
                                      interface interrupt. When a `1` is
     written to this
                                      register, the interrupt is cleared. This
     interrupt
                                      indicates that the AIIT register matches
     the
                                      AISLRCNT. This bit asserts regardless of
     the setting
                                      of AICR[AIMSK].
                                      Write:
                                      0 = No effect
                                      1 = Clear Audio Interface interrupt
                                      Read:
                                      0 = Audio Interface Interrupt has not
     been
                                      requested
                                      1 = Audio Interface Interrupt has been
     requested.
    2     AIINTMSK        RW    0 .times. 0 Audio interface Interrupt Mask:
                                      0 = interrupt masked

    1     AFR             RW    0 .times. 0 Auxiliary Frequency Register:
     Controls the sample
                                      rate of the streaming audio data. When
     set to 32 kHz
                                      sample rate, the SRC will convert the
     streaming
                                      audio data to 48 kHz. This bit should
     only be
                                      changed when Streaming Audio is stopped
                                      (AICR[PSTAT] set to 0).
                                      0 = 32 kHz sample rate
                                      1 = 48 kHz sample rate
    0     PSTAT           RW    0 .times. 0 Playing Status: This bit enables
     the AISLR clock
                                      which controls the playing/stopping of
     audio
                                      streaming. When this bit is AISLRCNT
     register will
                                      increment for every stereo pair of
     samples output.
                                      0 = Stop or Pause streaming audio (AISLR
     clock
                                      disabled)
                                      1 = Play streaming audio (AISLR clock
     enabled)
