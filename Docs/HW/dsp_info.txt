    Preface.
    --------

    This is collection of knowledge about working of GAMECUBE DSP. As you can
    see later, DSP is another small computer, inside cube. This text is not
    pretending on full DSP description, I just gathered all my software reverse
    engineering of DSP library and some info from patents.
    
    Corrections and additions are welcome.

    DSP is integrated with Flipper ASIC. It was developed by Macronix and
    licensed by Nintendo. It is using to produce advanced sound effects, like
    surround multi-channel sound, reverb and chorus, and else.

    Official GC SDK dont have any valuable information regardless DSP inner
    working. It is all proprietary.

    DSP Architecture.
    -----------------

      81 mhz instruction clock (1/6 of main CPU clock)
      40-bit add-and-multiply-result registers for calculations
      16-bit data addressing
      16-bit address space, including :
         8 KB Data RAM (DRAM)
         4 KB Data ROM (DROM)
         8 KB Instruction RAM (IRAM)
         8 KB Instruction ROM (IROM)
         and some hardware registers, to control internal hardware (see below)
      additional DSP internal hardware :
         custom ADPCM decoder
         cached memory interface to ARAM (also referred as "accelerator")
         DMA interface to main memory (to boot microcode)
         "mailbox" registers for communication with the CPU

    Details of memory mapping are unknown. It can be statically mapped areas,
    like on GameBoy, or DSP may have simple translation logic. I have a feeling
    that they are statically mapped.

    Now word to United States Patent 6,643,744 "Method and apparatus for
    pre-fetching audio data" :

    "DSP core has a 100 MHz (* 81 Mhz on production GC) instruction clock and
    uses 16-bit data words and addressing. DSP core uses a word (16-bit)
    addressable instruction memory that includes a RAM area (8 kbyte) and a ROM
    area (8 kbyte) and a word addressable data memory that includes a RAM area
    (8 kbyte) and a ROM area (4 kbyte). A DSP DMA is provided to transfer data
    from/to main memory, to/from the DSP data/instruction RAM areas or from the
    DSP data/instruction ROM areas to main memory. There are two requestors of
    access to instruction memory: DSP DMA and DSP. The instruction RAM area can
    be read/write by DSP DMA and can only be read by DSP. The instruction ROM
    area can only be read by DSP. There are three requestors of access to data
    memory: DSP DMA, data bus 1 and data bus 2. Mail box registers are provided
    for communication with the main processor. Mail box registers may include a
    first mail box register for communications from main processor to DSP core
    and a second mail box register for communications from DSP core to main
    processor. Each register is, for example, 32-bits wide. An accelerator is
    usable instead of DSP core to read from and write to audio memory. A memory
    controller is provided for audio memory and is operative, among other things,
    to arbitrate requests for audio memory access between DSP core and a
    dedicated DMA channel controlled by main processor, for data transactions
    between audio memory and main memory. Generally, data transactions between
    audio memory and DSP data memory have priority over DMA channel. A decoder
    decodes audio samples supplied thereto. Audio memory is intended primarily
    for the storage of audio-related data and may comprise 16 MB of RAM,
    expandable up to a total of 128 MB (* for developer boards)."

    I know, patents are hard to read :)

    Interrupts.
    -----------

    There are some *DSP* interrupts (not GC), which I guessed :

        Reset interrupt   - RES bit is set in DSPCR
        Halt interrupt    - HALT bit is set in DSPCR
        DSP interrupt     - INT bit is set in DSPCR
        Mailbox interrupt - generated when CPU is writing into output mailbox
                            register (to signal DSP about new mail).

    Mailbox Registers.
    ------------------

    0x0C005000      DSP Output Mailbox Register High Part (CPU->DSP)
    0x0C005002      DSP Output Mailbox Register Low Part (CPU->DSP)
    0x0C005004      DSP Input Mailbox Register High Part (DSP->CPU)
    0x0C005006      DSP Input Mailbox Register Low Part (DSP->CPU)

    Although patent is said they are 32-bit wide, Nintendo DSP library accessing
    them by 16-bit halfs. I dont know reason of that.

    Writing in mailbox register (from any side) will assert interrupt :

        If CPU->DSP mailbox, generate DSP mailbox interrupt;
        If DSP->CPU mailbox, generate PI DSP interrupt (see DSP Control Reg).

    Thats how CPU and DSP are "talking". Typically, some informative number
    is placed in mailbox register. It can be interpreted as command, or some
    DSP task status. It is fully depended on DSP microcode.

    If mailbox regs are accessing by half parts, there are probably some "shadow"
    registers, which are used to copy in real registers, when both halfs are
    written. As example :

        CPU writing some message to DSP : 0xBADADD1E (some number).
        Thats how DSP library will write it in DSP out mailbox :

        *(u16 *)0xCC005000 = 0xBADA;
        *(u16 *)0xCC005002 = 0xDD1E;

        As you see, DSP mailbox interrupt will be generated, after we write
        0xBADA, and DSP mailbox handler will get only 0xBADA???? message.

        With shadow registers, it will looks like this :

        *(u16 *)0xCC005000 = 0xBADA;  // shadow hi part = 0xBADA
        *(u16 *)0xCC005002 = 0xDD1E;  // shadow lo part = 0xDD1E
        // copy 0xBADADD1E into real mailbox, when both shadows are filled.
        // and "invalidate" shadow registers for new mail message.

    Mailbox reading is also performed under shadow registers.

    I dont have other explanation, why Nintendo accessing mailboxes by 16-bit
    halfs, except maybe if hardware designed to wait writes first into hi part
    and then to low part.

    Another questionable thing is high-order bit of mailbox registers. DSP
    library is checking this bit all the time, after writing/reading mailboxes :

        // mail delivered to DSP ?
        u32 DSPCheckMailToDSP(void)
        {
            return ( *(u16 *)0xCC005000 & 0x8000 );
        }

        // new mail from DSP ?
        u32 DSPCheckMailFromDSP(void)
        {
            return ( *(u16 *)0xCC005004 & 0x8000 );
        }

    It may be hardware-implemented read-only bit, but it may be set by loaded
    microcode/DSP mailbox interrupt handler (I mean microcode specific).
        
    DSP Control Register.
    ---------------------

    0x0C00500A      DSP Control Register (DSPCR)

    This register is messy, because it has not only DSP state, but also some
    bits for ARAM and audio DMA..

    Bits 10 and 11 are used during DSP initialization, in DSPInit and 
    __OSInitAudioSystem SDK functions. Meaning is unknown, but such code may
    be important :

        DSPCR &= ~0x0800            // clear bit11
        while(DSPCR & 0x0400);      // wait bit10 clear

    Known DSP Microcodes.
    ---------------------

    "During system initialization, a runtime audio library is downloaded to
    audio DSP. This audio library is used by audio DSP to process and mix voices
    in accordance with commands in a command list generated by main processor.
    The command list is stored in main memory. Audio DSP retrieves the commands
    from main memory and executes them in accordance with the runtime audio
    library downloaded thereto."

    I have seen following audio DSP libs :

         AX library. Shipped with official SDK from Nintendo.
         JAudio library. This library is used in Zelda and some other games
          from Nintendo. It is not using the same DSP library, as AX.

    I dont know details, but general difference between libraries is in mailbox
    messages format, and microcode program.

    SDK CARD library also has microcode, to "unlock" memory card.
