                             GC Emulation Tips.
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    General Emu Development
    -----------------------

    Any emulator development includes several stages :

                                                    Interpreter
    Disassembler -> Memory Emulation -> Debugger ->   and/or    -> Hardware
                                                    Recompiler

    Optional feature is HLE. NextGen consoles hardware emulation is often 
    realized, using plugin technology. There are some nice GAMECUBE plugins
    with Dolwin 0.10 ;)

    VI emulation tips
    -----------------

    VI have A LOT of different registers. You dont need to emulate them all.
    Here is the list of most important :

    CC002002 - for video mode (determining maximum hline value)
    CC00201C - for XFB address (if homebrewn VI XFB blitting is enabled)
    CC00202C - hline count
    CC002030 - To handle VI retrace interrupt.

    hline counter can be emulated in two ways :

    1. Constantly increase it after some interval, and clear when it reach
    its maximum value (depends on video mode).

    2. Switch it between some fixed values to cheat game libraries wait vsync
    routine. It will be faster, than previous method, but less compatible.
    (You dont need counter, but games can use different hline check values).

    Practically, VI is not much important to emulate. In Dolphin OS its used
    mainly to reschedule active threads and to control PAD sampling rate, and
    homebrewn are using it for output and for wait retrace routines. GAMECUBE
    GX can be emulated without EFB->XFB copying.

    Be careful : VI interrupt is cleared, when INT bit is cleared. Usually
    other hardware is clearing interrupt, by setting INT bit. But not VI!

    Summary : Your task in VI emulation is to make VIINT generated every
    fixed GC time intervals. Approximately 30 ms of GC time. (I use GC time
    term for TBR register, which count every 1/12 CPU clocks). Use your 
    debugger and make sure, that VIINT is generated at constantly rate.

    Here is small note for VI frame timing, which may help you :

     ---------------------------------------------------
    |       |         PAL         | NTSC, MPAL, EURGB60 |
    | value +---------------------|---------------------|
    |       |   NIN    |   INT    |   NIN    |   INT    |
    |=======+==========+==========+==========+==========|
    |  hz   |   50     |    25    |    60    |    30    |
    |-------+----------+----------+----------+----------|
    | lines |  312.5   |   625    |  262.5   |   525    |
    |-------+----------+----------+----------+----------|
    | active|   262    |   574    |   218    |   480    |
     -------+----------+----------+----------+----------

    NIN - non-intelaced (double-strike) mode (both odd and even lines in one frame)
    INT - interlaced mode (odd and even lines in alternating frames)

    I call all NTSC, MPAL and EURGB60 modes, as "NTSC-Like" in emu.

    FP FPSCR
    --------

    Emulating of FPSCR-register is unecessary. The only one interesting field
    is RN (rounding control). Affecting of rounding control on emulation
    run-flow is unknown.

    Note : At least zelda works fine without it.

    Fast FP context switching
    -------------------------

    GCN OS have optimized FP context switching. It doesnt saves FPU context
    each time, after exception or interrupt occurs. It switches FP context
    only when it was changed. This is possible with using of floating point
    exception (vector is 0x800).

    So, to avoid context bugs, when using multi-threaded applications, you
    should raise floating point exception, every time, after changing of FPR
    or PS registers (simply after every floating-point instruction).

    MSR bits
    --------

    Here is the list of important MSR bits :

    MSR[EE] - This one is used to mask external interrupts and decrementer
    exception. Emulator must check this bit, before rasing interrupt, or 
    when decrementer reaching zero value, as example :

        if(--DEC == 0)
        {
            if(MSR & 0x8000)    // EE bit mask
            {
                CPUException(DECREMENTER_INTERRUPT);
            }
        }

    MSR[RI] - Always set this bit after any exception! If this bit will be 
    cleared, OS halts as unexpected exception.

    MSR[FP] - See in previous tip.

    MSR[DR] and MSR[IR] can be optionally used for MMU emulation.

    Other bits shouldn't be used :)

    Exceptions
    ----------

    List of most important exceptions for correct emulation :

    0x500   External Interrupt. Very important :)
    0x800   Floating-point unavailable. For correct OS context switching.
    0x900   Decrementer. Used by OS alarm objects.
    0xC00   Optionally. You can fake system call opcode, and dont use it.
            But GC-Linux is using it, so you cant ignore it for homebrewn.
