1. Effective Address Memory Map (Dolphin OS):

80000000  24MB  Main Memory (RAM), write-back cached
C0000000  24MB  Main Memory (RAM), write-through cached
C8000000   2MB  Embedded Framebuffer (EFB)
CC000000        Command Processor (CP)
CC001000        Pixel Engine (PE)
CC002000        Video Interface (VI)
CC003000        Peripheral Interface (PI)
CC004000        Memory Interface (MI)
CC005000        DSP and DMA Audio Interface (AID)
CC006000        DVD Interface (DI)
CC006400        Serial Interface (SI)
CC006800        External Interface (EXI)
CC006C00        Audio Streaming Interface (AIS)
CC008000        FIFO
E0000000  16KB  L1 Locked Cache scratchpad buffer

Other memory access will ISI/DSI at first (if not mapped by MMU) and then 
Flipper memory interface interrupt (if its not mapped or protected).

Effective address map in other OSes (such as GC-Linux) maybe different.

Dolphin OS by default is not using page-table translation and segment registers.
Only block translation is used. Configuration of DBAT and IBAT registers in
Dolphin OS is as follow :

DBAT0: 80001FFF 00000002    Write-back cached main memory, 256MB block.
DBAT1: C0001FFF 0000002A    Write-through cached main memory, 256MB block.
DBAT2: 00000000 00000000    Reserved for user.
DBAT3: 00000000 00000000    Reserved for user.

IBAT0: 80001FFF 00000002    Write-back cached main memory, 256MB block.
IBAT1: 00000000 00000000    Reserved for user.
IBAT2: 00000000 00000000    Reserved for user.
IBAT3: 00000000 00000000    Reserved for user.

Additionaly OS set DBAT3, when locked cache is used:
DBAT3: E00001FE E0000002    Locked cache, 16MB block (only first 16KB is valid)

Although some applications use segment registers to simulate direct ARAM access.
GC-Linux also use segment registers and page tables for VM.

Do not use effective address map in your emulators. You must first translate effective
address by your MMU emu, and then emulate access to physical memory (see below).

2. Physical Address Memory Map (Flipper memory interface):

00000000  24MB  Main Memory (RAM)
08000000   2MB  Embedded Framebuffer (EFB)
0C000000        Command Processor (CP)
0C001000        Pixel Engine (PE)
0C002000        Video Interface (VI)
0C003000        Peripheral Interface (PI)
0C004000        Memory Interface (MI)
0C005000        DSP and DMA Audio Interface (AID)
0C006000        DVD Interface (DI)
0C006400        Serial Interface (SI)
0C006800        External Interface (EXI)
0C006C00        Audio Streaming Interface (AIS)
0C008000        FIFO
FFF00000   1MB  Boot ROM (first megabyte)

Unmapped memory access will generate Flipper memory interface (MI) interrupt.
See more details of Memory Interface in MI.txt.

3. Memory access details.

Effective address is translated by Gekko Memory Management Unit (MMU) to
Physical Address. Flipper hosts all memory operations by Memory Interface (MI).

                 ----------------

Access can be byte, halfword, word (32 bits), double-word and burst (32 bytes).
Burst transfer is used by cache-line store/fetch and gather-buffer store operation.

4. Undocumented memory feature.

First time when I saw it, I thought it was bug:

Uncached store byte to main memory:

Example address 0xC0000A00 (unused by any software).

Store byte 0xAA to 0xC00000A00:
C00000A00: AA 00 00 00 AA 00 00 00        (Flipper store 8 bytes)

Store byte 0xAA to 0xC00000A01:
C00000A00: 00 AA 00 00 00 AA 00 00        (Flipper store 8 bytes)

Store byte 0xAA to 0xC00000A02:
C00000A00: 00 00 AA 00 00 00 AA 00        (Flipper store 8 bytes)

Store byte 0xAA to 0xC00000A03:
C00000A00: 00 00 00 AA 00 00 00 AA        (Flipper store 8 bytes)

Uncached store halfword to main memory:

Example address 0xC0000A00 (unused by any software).

Store halfword 0xAABB to 0xC00000A00:
C00000A00: AA BB 00 00 AA BB 00 00        (Flipper store 8 bytes)

Store halfword 0xAABB to 0xC00000A01:
C00000A00: 00 AA BB 00 00 AA BB 00        (Flipper store 8 bytes)

Store halfword 0xAABB to 0xC00000A02:
C00000A00: 00 00 AA BB 00 00 AA BB        (Flipper store 8 bytes)

Store halfword 0xAABB to 0xC00000A03:
C00000A00: BB 00 00 AA BB 00 00 AA        (Flipper store 8 bytes, halfword wrapped)

Thing is, the bus allows only 64bit accesses. In cached regions, it will write
cachelines, so it will never hit the problem. It's not that uncommon, to not
connect the "byte store" lines.

Issue:
You cannot use memset() at uncached memory areas, because it will fill memory by
incorrect values. Cached byte and halfword access is NOT "buggy". Uncached word
and double-word access is NOT "buggy". Uncached read is NOT "buggy" also.

Application:
I measured CPU time (by Performance Monitor) which need to store byte by cached and
uncached address. Its the same! So you can clear 8 bytes of main memory by single
byte write much faster:

/* Fast clear routine, exploiting Flipper store byte "bug". */
void __fastclear(void *addr, int length)
{
    int i, tail;
    u8 *ptr;

    if(length < 8)
    {
        memset(addr, 0, length);
        DCBlockStore(addr);
        return;
    }

    tail = length % 8;
    length /= 8;
 
    for(i=0, ptr=OSCachedToUncached(addr); i<length; i++, ptr+=8)
    {
        *ptr = 0;
    }

    if(tail)
    {
        ptr = OSUncachedToCached(ptr);
        memset(ptr, 0, tail);
        DCBlockStore(ptr);
    }
}

This is 30% or more faster than usual memset.

5. Write Gather Pipe (or Gather-buffer).

Gather-buffer is circular 128 byte FIFO which collect stores to fixed physical
address and after amount of data reach 32 bytes, it blast block of data equals
to cache-line size (32-bytes, called "burst transfer") to external memory.

Gather-buf is enabled only when HID2[WPE] bit is set. You can set store physical
address by WPAR register (WPAR[GB_ADDR] field). WPAR[BNE] field shows you
whenever GB is empty or not.

To discard all current storing data just overwrite WPAR[GB_ADDR].
To flush gather-buf you must fill it by some dummy data, until it blast 32 bytes.

Do not store data by address with bits 0-26 equals to WPAR[GB_ADDR], but other bits
27-31 are not zero. Gather-buffer compare only bits 0-26 of physical address, otherwise
your store goes directly to main memory, bypassing gather-buffer.
Reading from WPAR[GB_ADDR] is not affected to gather-buffer. You will get value which
is stored in external memory at this moment.

Example Code:

void *gatherbuf;

static void EnableGatherBuffer(void)
{
    PPCMthid2(PPCMfhid2() | HID2_WPE);
}

static void DisableGatherBuffer(void)
{
    PPCMthid2(PPCMfhid2() & ~HID2_WPE);
}

static void FlushGatherBuffer(void)
{
    int i;
    for(i=0; i<31; i++) *(u8 *)gatherbuf = 0x00;
}

static void TestGatherBuffer(void)
{
    //
    // When directed to FIFO.
    //
    gatherbuf = 0xCC008000;

    PPCMtwpar(gatherbuf & 0x0FFFFFFF);
    PPCSync();
    EnableGatherBuffer();
    PPCSync();
    
    *(u8 *)gatherbuf = 0xAA;
    *(u16 *)gatherbuf = 0xAABB;
    *(u32 *)gatherbuf = 0x11223344;
    *(f32 *)gatherbuf = 1.0f;
    *(f64 *)gatherbuf = 1.0;                
    
    FlushGatherBuffer();
    DisableGatherBuffer();

    //
    // Redirected to main memory.
    //
    gatherbuf = 0xC0000A00;

    PPCMtwpar(gatherbuf & 0x0FFFFFFF);
    PPCSync();
    EnableGatherBuffer();
    PPCSync();
    
    *(u8 *)gatherbuf = 0xAA;
    *(u16 *)gatherbuf = 0xAABB;
    *(u32 *)gatherbuf = 0x11223344;
    *(f32 *)gatherbuf = 1.0f;
    *(f64 *)gatherbuf = 1.0;                
    
    FlushGatherBuffer();
    DisableGatherBuffer();
}

Result in both cases is following gather-buffer data:

0000: AA AA BB 11 22 33 44 3F
0008: 80 00 00 3F F0 00 00 00
0010: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0018: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

which is transferred to external memory via burst transfer.

ToDo.

Check unmapped physical memory space and hardware registers access modes.
