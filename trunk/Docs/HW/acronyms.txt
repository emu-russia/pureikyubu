    boards has "ARAM Expansion" (additional 4, 16 or 32 MBs).

    and IBAT special-purpose registers for data and instruction address 
    translation respectively.

    cannot be read on usual PC hardware. Whole GC DVD stuff is developed by
    Matsushita.

    architecture. Developed by Macronix. Devices drived by EXI: memory cards,
    broad-band adapter, real-time clock, bootrom, SRAM.

    to overwhelm it. Gekko has full support of IEEE 1149-1a-1993 JTAG standard
    (discussed).

GC, GCN, NGC
    Nintendo Gamecube.

GCM

    state-machine. Developed by ArtX team.

    used as stack pointer (sp).

GX
    Software library, developed by Nintendo and ArtX, to drive GP hardware.
    Has many crossways with OpenGL (but more advanced).

HW2
    Common name of GC hardware. Number states for revision ("2" for production
    boards, "1" for first development hardware).

MMU
    PPC Memory Management Unit. Translates virtual address to physical.

    everyone is using it anyway, instead "CIA" (Current Instruction Address).

PCM
    Pulse Code Modulation, method commonly used in digital sound hardware.
    PCM sound parameters are: playback rate, bits per sample, sample format.

    were equipped by switch, insted programmable reset button.

    for development on specified platform. Gamecube SDK contain development tools,
    like sound and texture convertors, and set of libraries for OS and hardware.
    Compiler is provided by Metrowerk's CodeWarrior. There also huge development
    board and paper documentation.

SI
    Serial Interface. Hardware responsible for communication with serial devices,
    such as GC controller and keyboard via serial I/O buffer.

SPR
    Special-purpose register. Set of registers, dedicated to operating system.
    Gekko has about 60 SPRs.

    Small amount of battery backuped memory for OS misc settings.

    address translations. Gekko has 128 two-way set associative TLB for each
    MMU (DMMU and IMMU).

VI
    Video Interface. Hardware responsible for TV-out of framebuffer (XFB),
    and generating VBlank interrupt (actually can be configured to interrupt
    CPU at any beam location). Has support for light-gun, antialiasing of XFB
    by tap-filters and progressive video mode (480p).

WBUF
    Gekko Write Gather Buffer. Small cache for burst memory transactions.
    Used together with graphics FIFO to send GP commands.
