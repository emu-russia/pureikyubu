<center><h3>1T-SRAM outside of Flipper</h3></center>

<p>The GameCube features another 24MB of 1T-SRAM that is located outside of the 
  Flipper chip which is used as its main memory. This 64-bit memory bus runs at 
  2x the operating clock of Flipper, or 324MHz resulting in 2.6GB/s of bandwidth 
  between Flipper and the Cube's main memory. While this is only as much memory 
  bandwidth as an original GeForce 256, remember that all of the Z-buffer accesses 
  are done on the embedded 1T-SRAM and the frame being drawn is done initially 
  to the on-die 2MB buffer. This reduces the need for as much main memory bandwidth 
  as we're used to seeing. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="mosys.jpg" width="400" height="278"><br>
  There are two 12MB 1T-SRAM chips located on the GameCube motherboard</p>
<p>But we're not too sure about Nintendo's decision to continue to use 1T-SRAM 
  even for the main memory. There are significantly faster <b><a class=highlight  title="Double Data Rate transfers allows for data to be fetched on both the rising and falling edges of the clock thus doubling the effective transfer rate of the clock.  For example a 100MHz DDR clock would achieve a peak transfer rate equal to that of a 200MHz clock.  The effective transfer rate is equal to the clock frequency multiplied by the bus width, doubled."><font color=navy>DDR</font></a></b> SDRAM devices out 
  there, not even as fast as the 200MHz DDR featured in the Xbox that would provide 
  much more memory bandwidth than the 1T-SRAM of the GameCube. This is one of 
  the points that it was unfortunately that the design was completed prior to 
  the ATI acquisition of ArtX since we may have seen a Radeon-like 128-bit DDR 
  memory bus used for the main memory in the Cube. The only benefit the Cube gains 
  from using 1T-SRAM as its main memory is low latency access and thus better 
  bus utilization; coupled with the fact that the memory bus is synchronized to 
  the Gekko's FSB and Flipper's operating frequency (162MHz x 2) we can assume 
  that latency is reduced as much as possible with this design. Again, we see 
  elements of the efficiency of GameCube rather than a focus on raw power.</p>
