# thirdparty

Various third-party libraries.

Design third-party components as static libraries and add them as a reference to the main project.

There are no restrictions on adding third-party code, but there is a recommendation to do this only in case of great need. I want the project not to become overgrown with unnecessary dependencies and to be self-sufficient.
